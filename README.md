# PyCT: Enhancing Concolic Testing for Python Libraries

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the ICSE 2025 review. This repository contains the implementation of our research on using PyCT to enhance concolic testing for Python libraries.

## Overview

Concolic testing, a hybrid approach combining concrete testing and symbolic execution, is a powerful method for identifying software vulnerabilities. This project focuses on leveraging PyCT, a concolic testing tool, to automate the generation of unittests and required inputs for Python libraries. Our goal is to improve testing coverage and detect potential vulnerabilities more effectively.


## Getting Started

To get started with running the code, you can begin with `coverage_ray/transformers/unittest_any.py`. This script serves as the entry point for executing the concolic testing process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyCT
- Any other dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`
